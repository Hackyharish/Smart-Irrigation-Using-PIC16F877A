# Smart-Irrigation-Using-PIC16F877A
This project automates irrigation using a PIC16F877A, DHT11 sensor, and soil moisture sensor to optimize water usage. It activates irrigation only when needed, preventing overwatering. The repo includes source code, a circuit diagram, and simulations. Future upgrades may add IoT monitoring and solar power.
